# DJS04 Project Brief: Book Connect - Web Components

Building upon your "Book Connect" project in DJS03, you will now dive into Web Components. This challenge will refine your skills in creating reusable, encapsulated, and interactive elements.

## Project Objective
Transform the book preview functionality of the "Book Connect" application into a fully operational Web Component. Additionally, evaluate and potentially convert other parts of the application into Web Components to enhance modularity and reusability.

## Project Overview
### Goals
- **Convert Book Preview to Web Component**: The main focus is to encapsulate the book preview feature into a Web Component, making it reusable and independent.
- **Assess Other Components**: Identify other elements within the "Book Connect" app that could benefit from being converted into Web Components.
- **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure that the application retains all its current functionalities after refactoring.

### Tasks
1. **Understand the Existing Codebase**: Familiarise yourself with the current structure and functionality of the "Book Connect" project, focusing on the book preview feature.
2. **Create a Web Component for Book Preview**:
   - Encapsulate the book preview into a Web Component.
   - Ensure that the component is self-contained, with its own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Test the component to ensure it works seamlessly within the app.
3. **Identify and Convert Other Components**:
   - Analyse the application to identify other potential components for conversion.
   - Prioritise components based on their reusability and importance to the app.
   - Convert the chosen elements into Web Components.
4. **Testing and Integration**:
   - Rigorously test the new components individually and within the context of the application.
   - Pay special attention to interactions between components and the overall user experience.
5. **Documentation**:
   - Document the process of creating the Web Components.
   - Include any challenges faced and how they were overcome.
   - Provide a clear guide on how the components should be used within the app.

## Discussion and Reflection

### Project Analysis

This project introduces us to the concept of web components and essentially it is facilitating the upcoming portfolio project which uses React.js. The project is a continuation of the previous project, which was to create a book connect application.
- The project is to convert the book preview feature into a web component. The book preview feature is the part of the application that displays the book cover, and book preview.
- The project also requires us to assess other components within the application and potentially convert them into web components. This is to enhance the modularity and reusabilty. This is to encapsulate the book preview feature into a web component
- I create created a BookPreview class that extends the HTMLElement 
- I created a constructor that sets the properties of the book preview component
- I created a connectedCallback method that renders the book preview component
- I created a render method that renders the book preview component
- I created a style method that sets the style of the book preview component
- I created a template method that creates the HTML for the book preview component


### Challenges and Reflections

I think the biggest challenge I faced while tackling this project was just really trying to wrap my head around the concept of web componets and how to create them and incorparate them in my code. I had to to do some extensive research about what are web components and the syntax and structure that is used to create them.
